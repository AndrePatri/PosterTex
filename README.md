# PosterTex

Simple LaTeX template, built on top of the [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) class, for clean research posters.

An example precompiled version of the poster (empty) is [here](https://github.com/AndrePatri/PosterTex/blob/main/poster.pdf). 

The template is super easy to customize, so feel free to add your logos and/or modify the layout and style.
